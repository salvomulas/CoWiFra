CoWiFra
=======

CooperativeWireframes is a web-based project management software for drawing and sharing GUI prototypes. It is intended to be used as a communication-improvement tool between a software development team. The software allows any user to create new projects and assign team members to it. For every project it is possible to draw an unlimited number of GUI-prototypes which can be exchanged with other team members.

GUI prototypes feature a versioning system that will track changes and keep the team informed about any modifications. Furthermore it gives you the possibility to revert any changes to get back to a previous version of the prototype.
